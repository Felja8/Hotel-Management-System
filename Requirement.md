# Project Guidelines

The project must include these components of taught during this course:


Modules
Databases (Sqlite)
Graphical User Interfaces (GUI) using tkinter
Object Oriented Programming (optional and bonus)
*****If the three mandatory parts are missing, then points will be decucted from the final score..******


The project must be modular (i.e. various functionalities like GUI, Databases CRUD must be in separate python modules).
To keep things simple and clean, you can use only the python native modules, with the exception of "faker" module which can create fake data for the projects. Keep things within the scope of this course.
Projects must have data, i.e. if there is no records exist in the database, then penality will be charged. (use faker module to include few old records.)

Use as much as functions to keep program simple and more understandable. (names must be meaningful)

# Submission Guidelines:
Per group only one submission is sufficient.
All python modules must be placed in a single directory and that can be zipped and submitted. This zip file must also contain one file (word or pdf) that explain the contribution of both the students, i.e. which parts are modules are developed by which student. However, in the presentation both parts must be presented by either of the students upon questioning. 


All the code will be tested and evaluated on the Python native IDLE, so make sure before submitted that it is working, codes with error will negatively effect towards final grade.


# Grading:
Nice and easy approach is the best approach.
All identifiers must have meaningful names. Style and Python Requirements must be met. 
Keep your GUI simple and eye pleasing (avoid using too bright colors).
Students efforts are appreciated.
Use the Header and inline documentation.
Program with errors will greatly effect the grades.
Late submission is not accepted.
Plagiarism is not allowed and if found, could lead to failing the course.

7-10 Minutes presentation must be given about the project and its functionality. Both students will be asked questions to see their understanding. They must understand all the project.
